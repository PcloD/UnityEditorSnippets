# UnityEditorSnippets
Collection of different editor things that help with productivity

## Structure
Every snippet is in separate file.
All hotkeys are in Hotkey.cs file.

## Contents

* PlayMode - quick play mode hotkey
* Pause
* Collapse Project - collapses all contents of the project window
* Collapse Hierarchy - collapses hierarchy (not perfect because scenes become uncollapsed, whoever works with multiscene fix this)
* Create Parent - creates parent for the selected gameobject in scene.

More to come, feel free to add yours, just follow the same structure.
